echo "\nHello there. It's been a harrowing few weeks. First your toenail issue, and now Great-Aunt Natasha's emu farm is in danger of being reposessed! So here you are---after a brief stopover at the Mayo clinic---in uncle Boris's remote cabin in the heart of the Terror Woods. Family legend holds that a golden statue of immense value is hidden somewhere within these walls. Unfortunately, you have a lot of stuff to do today, so you can only devote about 25 minutes to finding the statue. I guess we'll see what happens ;) \n\n";
