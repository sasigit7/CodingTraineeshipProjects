        <div class="prose">The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon,
            which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and
            excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited.
            Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all
            countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the
            matter.</div>

        <div class="prose">For some time past vessels had been met by “an enormous thing,” a long object,

        <div class="prose">The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects
            as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its

            and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those
            hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers
            times—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet,
            equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length—we might
            fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of
            the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which
            disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire
            world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the
            question.

        <div class="prose">On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam
            Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker
            thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact
            position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred
            and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of
            a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till
            then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour.</div>
